# Restaurant Ordering System (Java)

## Project Description
This project is a console-based Java application that simulates a simple restaurant ordering system.  
The user can view the restaurant menu, choose food and drink items, and place an order.  
Items can be selected either by name or by index number.

The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## How to Run
1. Install Java JDK 8 or higher.
2. Open the project in a Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. Follow the console instructions to add items to the order.
5. Enter `0` to finish the order and see the total price.

## Implemented Requirements
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation (private fields with getters)
- Inheritance (`FoodItem`, `DrinkItem`)
- Polymorphism:
    - Method overriding (`printInfo()`)
    - Method overloading (`searchByName(String)` and `searchByName(int)`)
- User input handling
- Order total calculation
